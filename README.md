* There is example DotPay payment implemented.

## How to implement more payment methods:
* Go to E-Shop-Engine.Services -> Services -> Payment and create new folder.
* There are 2 model classes that payment can inherit from: PaymentDetails (intended to send data to external server) and PaymentResponse (intended to receive data from external server).
* Create interface for service that inherit from IPaymentService. Then create the implementation.

        public class DotPayPaymentService : IDotPayPaymentService
        {
            private static Settings settings;
    
            public DotPayPaymentService(ISettingsRepository settingsRepository)
            {
                settings = settingsRepository.Get();
            } 
		
		    // The implementation...
	    }
	
* Now go to E-Shop-Engine.Website -> Controllers -> Payment and create new Controller.
* The controller should inherit from BasePaymentController.

        public class DotPayController : BasePaymentController
        {
            public DotPayController(
                IOrderRepository orderRepository,
                ICartRepository cartRepository,
                ISettingsRepository settingsRepository,
                IMailingService mailingService,
                IDotPayPaymentService paymentService,
                IAppUserManager userManager,
                IUnitOfWork unitOfWork)
                : base(
                      orderRepository,
                      cartRepository,
                      settingsRepository,
                      mailingService,
                      paymentService,
                      userManager,
                      unitOfWork)
            {
                //
            }
	
* Register new payment method in AutoFac (E-Shop-Engine.Website -> App_Start -> AutoFacConfig)
```builder.RegisterType<DotPayPaymentService>().As<IDotPayPaymentService>().InstancePerRequest();```
* Go to Views -> Payment -> Select and add new payment. Remember to set input element value the same as Controller name
```<div class="custom-control custom-checkbox form-control-lg">```
    ```<input type="radio" name="paymentMethod" class="custom-control-input" id="dotpay" value="DotPay">```
    ```<label class="custom-control-label" for="dotpay">```
        ```<img src="~/Content/payment/dotpay_logo.jpg" class="payment-img" />```
    ```</label>```
``` </div> ```
